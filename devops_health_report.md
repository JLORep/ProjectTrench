## ⚠️ Issues Requiring Attention

### 1. **Documentation Bloat** 🔴
- **Problem**: 403 backup files consuming 78MB
- **Impact**: Slower deployments, repository bloat
- **Solution**: Implement backup rotation policy

### 2. **Local Environment** 🟡
- **Problem**: Streamlit not installed locally
- **Impact**: Cannot run local tests
- **Solution**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### 3. **Deployment Timeouts** 🟡
- **Problem**: Some deployments timing out after 300s
- **Impact**: Inconsistent deployment success
- **Solution**: Optimize deployment scripts

### 4. **Module Import Errors** 🟡
- **Problem**: Validation showing import errors
- **Impact**: False negatives in validation
- **Solution**: Fix validation script environment

## 🔧 Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Clean Up Backups
```bash
# Remove old backup files
find . -name "*.backup_*" -mtime +7 -delete

# Count remaining backups
find . -name "*.backup_*" | wc -l
```

### 2. Fix Local Environment
```bash
# Upgrade pip
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Commit Pending Changes
```bash
git add deployment_validation.json
git commit -m "Update deployment validation results"
```
