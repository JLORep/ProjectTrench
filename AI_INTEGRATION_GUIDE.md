## ðŸ“¡ **WEBHOOK INTEGRATION**

### **For Live Telegram Channels:**
```python
# Send signals to AI pipeline
import aiohttp

signal = {
    "symbol": "PEPE",
    "contract_address": "0x...",
    "source": "your_channel",
    "message": "Original telegram message",
    "confidence": 0.8
}

async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
    async with session.post(
        "http://localhost:8000/webhook/telegram-signal",
        json=signal
    ) as response:
        result = await response.json()
```

### **API Endpoints:**
- `POST /webhook/telegram-signal` - Process new signals
- `GET /ai/performance` - Get AI performance stats  
- `POST /ai/analyze-batch` - Batch analyze multiple signals
- `GET /health` - Health check

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **CUSTOMIZING AI BEHAVIOR**

### **1. Adjust Risk Tolerance**
Edit `src/ai/claude_optimizer.py`:
```python
# More aggressive
if total_score >= 0.6:  # Lower threshold
    action = "BUY_AGGRESSIVE"
    position_size = 0.08  # Larger positions

# More conservative  
if total_score >= 0.9:  # Higher threshold
    action = "BUY_MODERATE"
    position_size = 0.02  # Smaller positions
```

### **2. Custom Signal Sources**
Add your channels to credibility scoring:
```python
credibility_scores = {
    'atm.day': 0.9,
    'your_premium_channel': 0.85,
    'your_channel': 0.7
}
```

### **3. Fine-tune AI Prompts**
Modify the Claude prompt in `_get_ai_optimization()` to:
- Focus on specific strategies
- Emphasize certain risk factors
- Adapt to market conditions
