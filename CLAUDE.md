## CRITICAL: Streamlit Deployment Issue - PYTHON COMPATIBILITY ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Status**: üîç Python version compatibility issue identified  
**Root Cause**: Streamlit Cloud Python 3.9 vs local Python 3.11 compatibility mismatch

**Solution**: Added Python version constraints and pinned exact dependency versions
**Impact**: Comprehensive compatibility fixes deployed (commit 5580364)

### Key Lessons Learned - Streamlit Cloud Deployment
1. **Python Version Mismatch**: Local Python 3.11 vs Streamlit Cloud Python 3.9 causes deployment failures
2. **Dependency Version Conflicts**: Flexible version ranges (>=) can cause compatibility issues
3. **Solution Strategy**: Pin exact versions and specify Python runtime constraints
4. **Diagnostic Tools**: Created comprehensive recovery and validation systems
5. **Import Failures**: Streamlit Cloud can't import local `src/` modules or custom packages
6. **Database Handling**: Live database connections fail gracefully with demo data fallback
7. **Version Control Files**: `.python-version`, `runtime.txt`, exact dependency pinning essential
