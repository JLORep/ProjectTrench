# üì° Discord Queue System - Rate Limit Management

## Overview
The TrenchCoat Pro Dev Blog System now includes comprehensive Discord rate limit queue management to ensure continuous message delivery without hitting Discord's API limits.

## Key Features

### 1. **Intelligent Rate Limiting** üö¶
- Respects Discord's 30 requests per channel per 60 seconds limit
- Tracks requests per channel independently
- Calculates exact wait times when rate limited
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff

### 2. **Priority Queue System** üìä
```python
class MessagePriority(Enum):
    CRITICAL = 1  # System alerts, critical updates
    HIGH = 2      # Feature releases, important updates  
    NORMAL = 3    # Regular blog posts
    LOW = 4       # Documentation, minor updates
```
- Messages are queued by priority
- Critical messages always sent first
- Maintains order within same priority level

### 3. **Queue Monitoring Dashboard** üìà
New "Queue Monitor" tab in the comprehensive blog system shows:
- Total queued messages
- Failed message count
- Channel-specific queue sizes
- Rate limit status per channel
- Queue processor status (Running/Stopped)

### 4. **Automatic Notifications** üîî
When rate limits are hit, the system:
- Sends notification to system-updates channel
- Shows current queue size
- Displays estimated wait time
- Provides queue status updates

### 5. **Failure Handling** üõ°Ô∏è
- Failed messages stored separately
- Max retry count of 3 attempts
- Manual retry option for failed messages
- Persistent storage for recovery

## Implementation Details

### Queue Processing Flow
```
1. Message added to channel queue (priority-based insertion)
2. Queue processor checks rate limit for channel
3. If OK: Send message, record timestamp
4. If rate limited: Calculate wait time, notify
5. On failure: Retry up to 3 times, then move to failed queue
6. Continue processing all channel queues
```

### Integration with Blog System
The comprehensive blog system now:
- Automatically queues all Discord messages
- Starts queue processor on demand
- Shows queue status after publishing
- Provides real-time monitoring interface

### Usage Example
```python
# Publishing an update now queues messages
system.publish_comprehensive_update(
    title="New Feature Release",
    category="feature",
    channels=["announcements", "dev-blog"],
    priority="high"
)
# Messages are queued and sent respecting rate limits
```

## Benefits

1. **No More 429 Errors** - Automatic rate limit handling
2. **Message Continuity** - No lost messages due to rate limits
3. **Priority Delivery** - Critical updates sent first
4. **Full Visibility** - Monitor queue status in real-time
5. **Automatic Recovery** - Failed messages can be retried

## Queue Monitor Interface

The Queue Monitor tab provides:
- Start/Stop queue processor controls
- Real-time queue statistics
- Channel-specific queue details
- Rate limit status indicators
- Failed message management
- Queue activity history

## Configuration

Set webhooks in the `discord_channels` dictionary:
```python
self.discord_channels = {
    'dev-blog': {'webhook': 'YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL'},
    'announcements': {'webhook': 'YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL'},
    # ... more channels
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start Queue Processor Early** - Start it when the app launches
2. **Monitor Failed Messages** - Check and retry periodically
3. **Use Appropriate Priorities** - Reserve CRITICAL for urgent updates
4. **Configure Notification Webhook** - Set system-updates webhook for alerts
5. **Regular Queue Checks** - Monitor the Queue Monitor tab

## Technical Stack

- **asyncio** for asynchronous queue processing
- **aiohttp** for non-blocking HTTP requests
- **SQLite** for queue persistence
- **Priority deque** for efficient queue management
- **Rate limit tracking** per Discord channel

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Queue analytics and reporting
- [ ] Automatic queue size alerts
- [ ] Batch message sending optimization
- [ ] Queue performance metrics
- [ ] Historical rate limit analysis
