# Dashboard Fixes Applied

## Fixed Issues

### 1. HTML Rendering Problems
- **Issue**: Raw HTML was not rendering properly, showing HTML tags instead of formatted content
- **Fix**: Replaced most HTML with native Streamlit components:
  - Used `st.metric()` for key metrics instead of custom HTML
  - Used `st.columns()` and `st.container()` for layouts
  - Used `st.progress()` for progress bars
  - Used `st.markdown()` with simple formatting instead of complex HTML

### 2. Async/Await Issues
- **Issue**: `asyncio.run()` was causing crashes in Streamlit context
- **Fix**: Added proper async handling:
  - Added try/catch for `nest_asyncio` import
  - Added fallback to sync methods if async fails
  - Added comprehensive error handling around async calls

### 3. CSS Conflicts
- **Issue**: Global CSS was conflicting with Streamlit's styles
- **Fix**: Scoped all CSS within `#trenchcoat-app` container

### 4. Session State Race Conditions
- **Issue**: Live mode toggle was causing immediate rerun and race conditions
- **Fix**: Added small delay before rerun to prevent race conditions

### 5. Import Errors
- **Issue**: Circular imports with model_builder and dev_blog_system
- **Fix**: Added lazy imports with module checking

### 6. Error Handling
- **Issue**: Errors were crashing the entire app
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive error handling:
  - Better error messages with context
  - Error logging to session state
  - Graceful fallbacks for all features

## Key Changes Made

1. **Header Section**: Simplified to use Streamlit columns and markdown
2. **Live Status Indicators**: Replaced HTML divs with column-based layout
3. **Coin Cards**: Complete rewrite using native Streamlit components
4. **Metrics Display**: All metrics now use `st.metric()` 
5. **Charts**: Kept as-is (Plotly charts work fine)
6. **AI Suggestions**: Simplified using columns and buttons

## Testing the Fixed Dashboard

Run the dashboard with:
```bash
streamlit run ultra_premium_dashboard.py
```

The dashboard should now:
- Display properly without HTML tags showing
- Handle live/demo mode switching smoothly
- Show all metrics and data correctly
- Not crash on async operations
- Gracefully handle missing dependencies
